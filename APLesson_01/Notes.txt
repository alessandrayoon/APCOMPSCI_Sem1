to become a java one. I then opened up Notepad++ and transfered my newly
created java (secondPRog.java) to begin making my art. I first copied the 
standard opening for the program(public class secondProg). Then I openend 
a new set of brackets and started the first line of my first ASCII art. I 
googled some examples of art and found a website that had varying degrees 
of difficulty in the art. I opted for a less complicated one as my first try 
and selected a rabbit consisting of 7 lines. I made sure to double up on the
backslashes when necessary as well as any other symbols that the computer 
"didn't like". Though it took a few tries and quite a few frustrating failures, I 
finally got my first ASCII art program done and ready to run. After selecting 
Javacompile then Javaexecute, I got somewhat of a rabbit. I had to adjust the 
font to correct the spacing as well as go back into the original program script 
to add more spaces manually in order to have the image line up. After saving it,
I went on to create my next ASCII art entitled, very creatively, thirdProg. I did 
this one very similarly yo my last and followed the same steps I did before. I 
made sure to copy the beginning section and add all the correct backslashes, semi-
colons, and brackets. This one went much more smoothly and the four line penguin 
I created came out almost perfectly on the first try.
